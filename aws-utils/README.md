# 2. set-s3-ia-lc

Sets S3IA lifecycle transitions for AWS S3 buckets.
Also aborts incomplete multipart uploads.

* Usage

  <pre>set-s3-ia-lc.sh -p \<AWS CLI profile> -r \<AWS region> [-d \<days>]</pre>

\# reads a list of S3 bucket names - one per line - from stdin

\# -p: AWS CLI profile (--profile arg of aws command)

\# -r: AWS region of the S3 buckets

\# -d: Number of days (>= 30) after which an asset has to move from S3 to S3-IA (default = 30)

* Pre-requisites

  * [aws-cli] (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) needs to be installed & configured with your AWS a/c credentials.
 
* Example run

  Run the script for all buckets in ap-south-1 region with the AWS CLI profile "test-aws-account"
  <pre>$ aws --profile=test-aws-account s3 --region=ap-south-1 ls | awk '{print $3}' | set-s3-ia-lc.sh -p test-aws-account -r ap-south-1 -d 45</pre>
  
* Dependencies
 
  1. A reference JSON file "s3_to_ia_lifecycle.json" in the same directory where this script is being run from. The JSON can be infered from a skeleton generated with this command:
  
  <pre>$ aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle --generate-cli-skeleton</pre>

 * Tested on macOS 10.12.5 with aws-cli/1.15.60 Python/3.7.0 Darwin/16.6.0 botocore/1.10.59
