=== client.go

This is a golang redigo based redis client that can be used to open (many)
concurrent connections to a redis server, with socket lingering off. Due to
this, the client gets to close all open concurrent connections as soon as
possible, without the sockets entering TIME_WAIT state.

redigo-solinger $ ./client -h
Usage of ./client:
  -cps=5: # concurrent clients per second
  -durs=60: # duration in seconds, of the entire run
  -gaps=5: # gap in seconds between concurrent bursts

===

In order to achieve this sort of concurrency, the following changes are
suggested on the client side:

1. Increase soft & hard limits on open FDs for root & normal users

	ubuntu@redigo-client:~$ tail -7 /etc/security/limits.conf

	*    soft nofile 64000
	*    hard nofile 64000
	root soft nofile 64000
	root hard nofile 64000

	# End of file

2. Enable the limits in /etc/pam.d/common-session and /etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive by adding this line:

session required pam_limits.so

===

And on the (redis) server m/c:

1. Increase FDs as on the client side

2. Increase maximum client connections in redis.conf as apt

3. And tune system networking as follows
	ubuntu@redis-ports:~$ tail -27 /etc/sysctl.conf

	# Allow reuse of sockets in TIME_WAIT state for new connections
	# only when it is safe from the network stack’s perspective.
	net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1

	# pending connections are kept in a socket buffer; 500K per socket
	#
	net.core.rmem_max = 500000
	net.core.wmem_max = 500000

	# Increase the number of outstanding syn requests allowed.
	# c.f. The use of syncookies.
	net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 10000
	net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

	# The maximum number of "backlogged sockets".  Default is 128.
	net.core.somaxconn = 10000

	# How may times to retry before killing TCP connection, closed by our side.
	# Avoids too many sockets in FIN-WAIT-1 state (default 0 which means 8!).
	# (see also: /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_orphans)
	net.ipv4.tcp_orphan_retries = 1

	# Time to hold socket in state FIN-WAIT-2, if it was closed by our side
	# Reduces time for sockets to be in FIN-WAIT-2 state (default 60secs).
	net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 30
	#
	ubuntu@redis-ports:~$

	And run 'sysctl -p' after modifying sysctl.conf as above

monitor-redis-conns: Run it on both the client & redis server as:
	$ ~/bin/monitor-redis-conns > ~/tmp/redis-load.op 2>&1 &
	$ # remember to stop the monitor after the load test ends

client: Run it as
	$ ./client -h
	$ ./client -cps 8000 -durs 20 > ~/tmp/op 2>&1 &
