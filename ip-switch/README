# How to try it out:

## The multicast UDP switch

1. Enable multicasting on your m/c 

2. Run two netcat sessions, as two udp sources
   * nc -i 5 -u 228.0.0.4 5001 < /dev/zero
   * nc -i 5 -u 228.0.0.4 5002 < /dev/random

3. Run mc_rx.go as the multicast sync, say configured to listen on 228.0.0.50:6001

4. At this stage, the traffic from the sources is not yet reaching the sync. Now, run
   the switch configured to switch between the above sources & push the switched data
   to the destination.

5. Stop (Ctrl-Z, say) source#1 and see the switch picking data from the
   source#2. Now, stop source#2 and see the switch to source#1 (which is stopped).
   The switch keeps looking for one of the sources to become available, until one of
   them is resumed.
